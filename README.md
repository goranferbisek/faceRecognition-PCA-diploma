## Abstract
The field of face recognition is dealing mostly with security system applications. Only a small portion of these applications are made with entertainment in mind. Most of the software on the market is written for personal computers. This was our motivation to make an entertainment application for Android mobile operating system. The application use is intended for comparing persons faces to celebrities. In our case, we chose football players. The user directs the smart phone’s camera towards a persons face and captures it. As a result, the application shows which face in the database, it resembles the most. We made an overview of similar applications currently available. We also described several face recognition methods. Our implementation of Principal Component Analysis was described in detail. Our method was tested on FERET database of facial images. We described the procedure of image preparation for best results possible.

Keywords: face recognition, Principal Component Analysis, Android, openCV, FERET
